                A programming language is a formal system designed to instruct a computer by specifying a set of
                instructions that can be executed to perform various tasks. It serves as an intermediary between human
                understanding and machine execution, allowing developers to communicate with computers. Programming
                languages encompass syntax, semantics, and rules that dictate how code is written and executed, enabling
                the creation of diverse software applications.
